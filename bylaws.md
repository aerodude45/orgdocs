## DHMN Bylaws

### Section 2 - Purpose

The organization is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, educational, and scientific purposes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or corresponding section of any future federal tax code.

The primary purpose of DHMN is to empower and ensure the survival of the thriving community that currently meets in two contexts - the brick and mortar building currently located at 120 N. Morrison Street in Appleton, Wisconsin and the virtual members that participate on the group’s mailing list, website, and social media outlets.  DHMN’s physical location is called “The Appleton Makerspace, powered by DHMN”.  The Appleton Makerspace is a community workshop with a health-club membership model.  We are a cross of machine shop, electronics manufacturer, programmers co-op and art studio, but with mentors, classes and personal project space

In addition to exploring the benefits of productivity through volunteer collaboration, the DHMN’s primary objectives are to create, educate, share and learn.  DHMN wishes to be a good neighbor to all hackers and makers by collaborating with and encouraging makerspaces around the world, whether they are long-existing organizations or emerging groups

####Section 2.2 - Makerships (“Sweat Equity” members

The board may choose to allow certain people to hold the privileges of membership without paying the the full fee amounts typically associated with membership.  This is typically due to a service being performed by that person which is deemed as vital to the functioning of the organization, sometimes in combination with some sort of financial need that prevents them from paying the full membership amount.

The board votes on the term length of the makership recipient, and can vote to revoke makerships based on the behavior of the recipient(s) or the financial needs of the organization.

## ARTICLE III – Organizational Meetings and Voting

### Section
1 - Organizational Meetings

Organizational meetings are run typically on a monthly basis.  The meetings function on a loose approximation of Robert’s Rules of Order.  The member currently serving as President typically runs these organizational meetings.  Typically, a member at each meeting is given the role of parliamentarian and has the right to settle questions of meeting procedure in case of dispute.  Most organizational decisions are made at the organizational meeting level, including the creation of smaller committees that are given the power to make smaller decisions outside the bounds of the organizational meetings within a specifically defined mandate by the larger organization.

### Section 2 - Board Referendums

Larger organizational decisions (such as the granting of makerships, expulsion of members, and dissolution of the organization) are given “board referendum status”.

The person currently serving as President has the ability to determine which issues qualify as significant enough to be considered Board Referendum questions.

Board referendums must be submitted to a board member for sponsorship. If sponsored, a proposal must be made publicly available for review, with members being sent a link to or copy of the proposal via the DHMN mailing
list, for no less than three days before the proposal may be voted on
(usually at the monthly organizational meeting). Proposals shall be voted upon by the board of directors. The methods for determining the result of proposal vote are as follows:

1. A quorum for board meetings shall be three board members participating (in person or remotely) in the meeting. 
2. Majority of “Yea” votes will cause vote to pass. 
3. A proposal vote can only be re-proposed once. A second vote resulting in a majority of "Nay" will cause a proposal to permanently fail. 
4. In the event of a tie vote, the proposal fails. 
5. The President may vote and may sponsor proposals 

The Secretary will keep a record of which decisions are made using the “Board Referendum vote” by specifically noting them as a “Board Referendum Vote”.  This record keeping shall begin at the time that this rule was put into practice (date here).

In the case of a tie vote by the board, the result of a popular vote of all current members in good standing will serve as the tiebreaker.

### Section 2 - Board of Directors

The Board of Directors, a.k.a. board, a.k.a. board of officers, is defined as all current elected officers of the DHMN.  

#### Section 3 - Elections for the Officers:

Elections shall occur annually at dates determined by the sitting Officers and
shall be open to all active member and be communicated via the DHMN mailing list.  Each voter shall vote “Yea” or “Nay” for each candidate. The candidate with the most "Yea" votes is elected. Tie votes shall require a run-off vote. When the election results are confirmed and announced, the Officer seats are vacated and assumed by the newly elected member.
