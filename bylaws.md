## 3 – Organizational Meetings and Voting

### 3.1 - Organizational Meetings

Organizational meetings are run typically on a monthly basis.  The meetings function on a loose approximation of Robert’s Rules of Order.  The member currently serving as President typically runs these organizational meetings.  Typically, a member at each meeting is given the role of parliamentarian and has the right to settle questions of meeting procedure in case of dispute.  Most organizational decisions are made at the organizational meeting level, including the creation of smaller committees that are given the power to make smaller decisions outside the bounds of the organizational meetings within a specifically defined mandate by the larger organization.

#### 3.1.1 - Board Referendums

Larger organizational decisions (such as the granting of makerships, expulsion of members, and dissolution of the organization) are given “board referendum status”.

The person currently serving as President has the ability to determine which issues qualify as significant enough to be considered Board Referendum questions.

Board referendums must be submitted to a board member for sponsorship. If sponsored, a proposal must be made publicly available for review, with members being sent a link to or copy of the proposal via the DHMN mailing list, for no less than three days before the proposal may be voted on (usually at the monthly organizational meeting). Proposals shall be voted upon by the board of directors. The methods for determining the result of proposal vote are as follows:

1. A quorum for board meetings shall be three board members participating (in person or remotely) in the meeting. 
2. Majority of “Yea” votes will cause vote to pass. 
3. A proposal vote can only be re-proposed once. A second vote resulting in a majority of "Nay" will cause a proposal to permanently fail. 
4. In the event of a tie vote, the proposal fails. 
5. The President may vote and may sponsor proposals 

The Secretary will keep a record of which decisions are made using the “Board Referendum vote” by specifically noting them as a “Board Referendum Vote”.  This record keeping shall begin at the time that this rule was put into practice (date here).

In the case of a tie vote by the board, the result of a popular vote of all current members in good standing will serve as the tiebreaker.
